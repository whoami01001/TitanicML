# TitanicML Project README

## Overview
This project involves training and evaluating two machine learning models with different feature manipulation strategies. The goal is to compare their performance and assess their effectiveness in a specific task.

## Models
- **Model01**: This model was trained using features with minimal manipulation or correction.
- **Model02**: This model utilized heavily manipulated features, with ideas primarily sourced from another Kaggle platform user.

## Performance

### Accuracy 
- **Model01**: 0.954545
- **Model02**: 0.856459

### Leaderboard Scores
- **Model01**: 0.76555
- **Model02**: 0.77272

## Results
Despite Model01 achieving a higher accuracy on the training data, Model02 performed better on the leaderboard. This suggests that the feature manipulation in Model02 may have improved its generalization to unseen data, despite a lower accuracy in training.
